I) What's that
--------------

This program is a very simple GUI for CDI4DC. It uses mkisofs (for creating the ISO), ipinj 
(for inserting the IP.BIN in the generated ISO) and cdi4dc (ISO to CDI).

II) How to use it
-----------------

Extract the latest release of cdi4dc in the Tools directory. Run the proggy. In the first field,
select your source directory (where Dreamcast files are located). You can add a custom IP.BIN if you
want and change the temp ISO image location. And in the last field, enter your disired CDI.

You can change the CD label if you want.

After doing this, just click Make.
